        <ul>
          <li>8 rashers smoked back bacon</li>
          <li>4 skinless chicken breasts</li>
          <li>25 g firm mozzarella, grated</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan) mark 6 and line a baking tray with foil. Wrap 2 bacon rashers around each chicken breast, overlapping them slightly. Put the wrapped chicken breasts on the prepared baking tray and cook in the oven for 25-30min, until chicken is cooked through.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, mix both cheeses together in a small bowl, set aside.</li>
          <li>Remove chicken from oven. Spread 1/2tbsp barbecue sauce on each chicken breast and sprinkle over the cheese. Return to the oven for 5min, until the cheese has melted. Serve with mashed potato and steamed vegetables, if you like.</li>
